# tuples are immutable
# tuples are ordered collection of items
# tuples can store any data types
# you cannot change(add or delete) values from tuple once it created
# but can add, delete data from list which is present inside tuple

# no append, no pop, no insert, no remove
# only count and index

# functions can be performed
# min(), max(), len(), sum()
