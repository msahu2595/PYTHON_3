# immutable means in python you cannot change the characters of string variables.
# although you can assign another variable that strings with some changes or as it is.
# but you cannot change the strings value

# here same variable give output defferent because i assign new value in variable name stering.
# cause python uses interpreter, it executed each line one by one.
# so therefore it gives output line by line.
