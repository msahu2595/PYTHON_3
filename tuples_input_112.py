# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update
# data inside tuple

example = ('one', 'two', 'three')
# no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
# days = ('monday', 'tuesday')
# tuples are faster than lists

# methods
# count, index
# len function 
# slicing
print(example[:2])

# you can not do item assignment
example[0] = 1
print(example)
